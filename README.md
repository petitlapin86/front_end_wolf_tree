Web Application Development

WEEK 1

-Created basic file structure
-Created basic page layout using solely HTML5

WEEK 2

- Added 2 stylesheets (one for screen one for print)
  * I tried to organize the main stylesheet by section
  * I created a special p element that only shows on print about the menu and spotlight events
  * validated both for (0) errors

- Created and styled a nav bar

- Worked on CSS GRID layout:
 * As I am just beginning to understand Grid,
 I created multiple grids per page essentially a new one per section.
 I did this just so that I could really learn from it in a way that was manageable.
 * I created a grid for the nav, the footer and the intro + main content on each page

- Styled a button for origin story:
  * this will contain the paragraph that is commented out - I thought maybe once we get to javascript this can become a pop-up

- Created hover effects in the intro to the menu and the spotlight pages:
  * these are target links that jump to certain parts of the same page

- Changed instagram text link to a image link

- Imported two google fonts and used throughout

- Came up with a color palette and used throughout

- refined styling of the list (on the menu page) and the table (on the find us page)

- Changed about.html to index.html

- Added the  <meta charset="UTF-8"> to the head


Things I would like to continue to work on:
- The spotlight page grid was giving me some trouble - this was an extra credit page I created from last week and I will continue working on its layout tomorrow after submission deadline.
